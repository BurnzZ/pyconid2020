We are excited to introduce [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) as a Platinum Sponsor for PyCon Indonesia 2020.

> Microsoft is the leading platform and productivity company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world, and its mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.

> Microsoft and PyCon have had a strong relationship globally for the past 5 years. Microsoft has worked with Python communities to create tools and services which provide ease of development. In this PyCon, Microsoft is super excited to share the improvements weâ€™ve made for Python developers in Azure, especially our newer offerings that enable you to build and deploy Python applications in the cloud at any scale. Tune into Microsoft sessions to learn more about managing data science pipeline with VS code, serverless being the future, and responsible AI.
