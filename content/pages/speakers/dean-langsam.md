speaker_bio: I am a data scientist at SentinelOne, a rapidly-growing cybersecurity AI company. I am interested in data science, machine learning, deep learning, Python scientific programming, data visualizations, and Bayesian modeling. Specifically, I am a pandas enthusiast, and maintain dovpanda - a pandas companion package that helps data scientists with writing better, more concise pandas code.
talk_abstract: Python can do so much, including using python to change python behavior. In this talk, we will see how we can hook any function in order to create an online “helper” in the style of Clippy for the old Office software. This can be useful for referencing to internal wikis, to suggest better ways to write code, add logging, timing, and/or so much more, without requiring the user to do anything on their part except for adding a single import statement. We’ll talk about many python internals, such as: ast, inspect, contextmanager
