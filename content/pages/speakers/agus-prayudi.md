talk_abstract: Object detection often requires testing to determine how the systemâ€™s ability to detect an object. However, what if the environment and conditions do not allow developers to test prototypes? for example, detect a ship in the middle of the sea. Therefore, simulate the prototype in an artificial environment is important to do. So, we could test our computer vision model easier.
