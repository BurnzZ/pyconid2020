speaker_bio: "Anand is a co-founder of Gramener, a data science company. He leads a team that automates insights from data and narrates these as visual data stories. He is recognized as one of India's top 10 data scientists, and is a regular TEDx speaker.<br/>Anand is a gold medalist at IIM Bangalore and an alumnus of IIT Madras, London Business School, IBM, Infosys, Lehman Brothers, and BCG.<br/>More importantly, he has hand-transcribed every Calvin & Hobbes strip ever, and dreams of watching every film on the IMDb Top 250."
talk_abstract: "Thereâ€™s a powerful way to fight dengue. Infect a mosquito with Wolbachia, release it in highly populated regions, and wait for it to infect all mosquitoes in the region.<br/>But this process is expensive, and we need to release it in the most densely populated regions in a city.<br/>And no one really knows what population density is at a 100m x 100m level.<br/>Can we use satellite imagery and use this to identify building density?
Can we use building density to figure out the most densely populated regions?<br/>Can we validate and triangulate this with other sources?<br/>This talk is a step-by-step walkthrough of how to use deep-learning models to classify satellite images based on OpenStreetMap building data, to create a more accurate population map than is publicly available.<br/>You will learn how to run deep-learning models on geo-spatial data."
