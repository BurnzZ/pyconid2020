speaker_bio: I am a technologist currently focusing on making a social impact. <br/>I write blog posts and tweet fairly regularly. I do speak at developer events from time to time. <br/>I live and breathe open-source. I created the world’s first truly headless web browser, PhantomJS, used by thousands organizations for web automation. I authored Esprima, the world’s first proper JavaScript parser in JavaScript and one of the most popular npm modules (80M monthly downloads). <br/>In the past, I was involved with various FOSS (free and open-source) communities, contributing to high-profile projects such as WebKit, KDE, and Qt. <br/>I worked for two start-ups, Shape Security and previously Sencha. At Shape Security, I led its 50-person engineering team. I helped building the team and the product from the ground-up, from its conceptual stage to the first customer deployment and now protecting top Fortune 500 banks, airlines, retailers from various attacks: credential stuffing, account take over, site scraping, etc. <br/>In the past, I studied engineering physics at the Institute of Technology Bandung (Indonesia). I pursued and obtained my doctorate degree (magna cum laude) in Electrical Engineering from the University of Paderborn (Germany). My name has been listed as the author/co-author of over 30 research papers in the field of fiber optic communication system.
