talk_abstract: In this session, I will give a brief presentation about the use of Python in the geoscientific subject. I will mention some of the actual practices in the industries and researches. I would like to show the audience the ability of Python to help their daily tasks. For example, to overcome the limitation of their currently owned software to perform other possible options for specific analysis or even performing analysis that they havenâ€™t had the software yet. I will present an example for each ML and non-ML case from my previous works. The non-ML case is adapted from my MSc thesis, using python to process an aeromagnetic data for geothermal study and the ML case is part of an under reviewed paper I submit in IJOG recently about the application of regression for missing well log prediction.
